# Automatic Fish Feeder using Arduino Uno

This Project meets the goal of making a cheap fish feeder for my aquarium when I am not home.

## Getting Started

1. Download the source on your disk and upload the sketch in code folder to arduino uno using the Arduino IDE.
2. Make the connections of your circuit using the components listed in the prereuisites.


### Prerequisites

You will need two 1k ohms resiters , one 5v DC motor (not a servo motor) , nine male-male jumper cables , one power cord for arduino , an Arduino Uno , A n-channeled MOSFET (any will do, as long as it works as voltage regulator) and a single LED to act as indicator.
